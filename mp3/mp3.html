        <h1>MP3 Writeup</h1>
        <h2>Overview and Usage</h2>
        <p class="intro-paragraph">
          This project's objective was to combine two libraries to create a game and learn about dependencies 
          and how toll rollup and deploy. My game is a "Save the Puupies" game that requires you to catch (hover over) 
          atleast 15 puppies that are falling before they hit the water, otherwise you lose a point. Once you save 
          15 puppies you win! The puppies are all falling at different speeds to make it more challenging. 
          I combined the p5 and p5.play libraries in this project.

        <h2>Development Process</h2>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>I first started by looking through looking at all the p5.play examples page and saw all the 
                functions and features that were available to use in a game.
            </li>
            <li>After looking, I decided on the concept of my game. <em>Something falling and not being 
                allowed to touch something else.</em>
            </li>
            <li>After deciding on my game concpet, I  went through the p5.play examples again and looked
                for all the different elements that I would need for my game.  
            </li>
            <li>I found multiple examples that had features and functinalitlies that I needed. I started with 
                copying over an example that had falling blocks. 
            </li>
            <li>I adapted the falling blocks to match the concept of my game. I created a loop to randomize 
                the speed at which the blocks where falling. 
            </li>
            <li>I then found an example that made an object disappear on a mouse hover and implemented that onto 
                my falling blocks. 
            </li>
            <li>After that I looked through the documentation for how to detect a collision/overlap of objects. I wanted
                 the blocks to disappear/lose points if it collieded with the water at the bottom of the screen.  
            </li>
            <li>After implementing that I was able to take it to the customization phase of adding images/animations 
                for my shapes such as the water block on the bottom and the falling blocks.  
            </li>
            <li>Finally, worked on the concept of winning and losing the game by keeping track of a score and displaying 
                winning or losing text based on the score count. 
            </li>
            <li>I ended with working thorugh the rollup and deployment steps and worked thorugh some debugging steps throught that. 
            </li>

        <h2>Issue Deep-Dive</h2>
        <p>
            One issue I encountered was I had everything working locally when I did npm start. However, 
            after following Hannah's steps and advice from Discord and adding the 5 scripts for p5 packages 
            into hy index.html and then deploying it. The screen was blank and my game was not working. This 
            did not make sense to me. However, after working with Hannah, we noticed that the packages and script that I had
            initally added to index.html (and had commented out after adding the ones Hannah had showed) were 
            an older version of p5 than the ones Hannah had added. Therefore, my code was not compatible with the 
            packages/versions of p5.play that were added after. I had to then take those out and return to the original 
            scipts that I had included to make the game run on deployment. 
        </p>
        <h2>Ideas and Future</h2>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I would like to add audio effects to game such as everytime you a puppy hits the water 
              or when you save a puppy. 
            </li>
            <li>
              I would also like to add dogs falling at different times and not just different rates.  
            </li>
            <li>
              In the future I would also like to add an option of what is falling and you have to save. 
              The user could pick dogs, cats, flowers, etc.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Kudos</h2>
        <p>
            I want to give to Hannah for staying late in OH to help me debug my deployment.
