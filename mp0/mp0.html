        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p class="intro-paragraph">
          I started by going through the instructions page of the assignment and understanding what the final output of this
          assignment would look like. I then went one bullet at a time of the requirements and started implementing those. To create 
          new pages, I used the templates of the pages that were already created and I would modify them to meet the needs of the
          page. I would look up things on the internet that I didn't know how to do and needed syntax help with.

          alt="Image of portfolio page with uncentered title text"
          />

        <h2>Issues</h2>
        <p>
          I had an issue trying to find my cloned repo in my local folders. I asked Hannah about my issue and turns out 
          that I had named my repo ".github.io" and if you have a folder that starts with a "." in your file system, it thinks
          it is invisible, hence why I couldnâ€™t see it in my folders but knew it existed. To fix this I had to rename my repo
          on github and reclone it onto my laptop. 
        </p>
        <h2>CSS Transition</h2>
        <p>
          The transition I implemented was having the title of my homepage bounce. I chose this because it seemed
          fun and I wasn't really satisfied with the other transitions I had played around with. To do the animation
          I searched on google "bouncing text css" and found a blog that had step-by-step instructions on how to implement it. 
          I followed those steps and adapted them to my website to create the effect.

              />

        <h2>Ideas and Future</h2>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Have a seperate page for each of my individual projects with a wrtie up for each
            </li>
            <li>
              Labels for each available tab so I know what my available navigation choices are
            </li>
            <li>
              More animations to make the website more engaging. 
            </li>
          </ul>
