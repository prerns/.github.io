        <h1>Final Project MVP Writeup</h1>
        <h2>Overview and Usage</h2>
        <p class="intro-paragraph">
           This final project prototype is intended to serve as a MVP of my final project. I have created 
           an artboard on p5 that currently is able to save and clear the artboard as well as change the 
           artboards background color and draw lines. This is the first iteration of my final. 
           <div class="tile-grid">
            <a href="https://prerns.github.io/fp_prototype/" style="--color: var(--cyan)"
            alt="Link to Artboard Prototype">
                <div>Artboard Prototype</div>
            </a>
          </div>
          <img 
          class="picture"
          src="/images/mvp_vid.gif" 
          alt="GIF of my prototype artboard that can clear the board, change the background color and draw lines"
          />
        </p>
        <h2>Development Process</h2>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Created a canvas to be my artboard</li>
            <li>Implemented a slider using the createSlider function that changes the background color of the canvas</li>
            <li>I created a button that implemented the save method to save the artboard to the users computer</li>
            <li>I created a clear button and worked through different methods of clearing the artboard and looked at many examples online</li>
            <li>I created a button to draw lines and implemented a method to draw lines on mouse press that I had 
                used in my sketches. 
            </li>
            <img 
            class="picture"
            src="/images/mvp_unfinished.jpeg" 
            alt="Image of a grey blank artboard"
            />
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Issue Deep-Dive</h2>
        <p>
            One issue I had was trying to create a function that would clear the artboard. after looking 
            into the clear and remove methods from p5 I realized that those methods would not perform what I wanted. 
            After looking at some examples online, I tried to create a function that would draw a rectangle the size of 
            the canvas over the current artboard as a way of creating a new blank canvas that was filled with the same 
            background color that was selected. However, when I tried to draw lines again on this new artboard nothing would show up. 
            After some trouble shooting, I figured out that the array that was storing the lines was not being cleared when the clear button was being called 
            so the lines were being drawn on the layer under. Then I tried another method of just setting my lines array to an empty array 
            to "clear" the artboard instead of drawing a new canvas over the existing one this worked!
        </p>
        <h2>Ideas and Future</h2>
        <p>
          The next iteration of my project will be to add additional shapes that can be drawn on the artboard 
          as well as working on aesthetics of my buttons. 
        </p>
        <h2>Kudos</h2>
        <p>
            I want to give Kudos to Elliana and Hannah for helping troubleshoot issues 
            and working together to discuss ideas for how to clear the artboard.  
        </p>
        <h2>Project scope</h2>
        <p>
            Not much of my project scope has changes since I completed this prototype. I think 
            I have successfully been able to trouble shoot issues I've had so far that I can see 
            having been problems for my final. I paced myself well too to be able to complete everything
            I wanted for the prototype and now for the final.
        </p>
        <h2>Time management</h2>
        <p>
        I definetely spent way more time on my prototype than I anticipated. I spent close to 5 hours on it.
        There were definetely some unexpected roadblocks such as figuring out the clear the artboard. I had 
        expected the clear function of P5 to do the job however that function is for a different purpose than
        the one I was trying to perform so I had to trouble shoot and try out multiple different methods of 
        trying to clear the artboard.
        </p>
        <h2>Implementation Plan</h2>
        My implementation plan hasn't really changed much. I still plan to do everything I had planned
        for originally for my final however some of the methods and developmental processes have changed. My 
        plan for how to incorporate different shapes based on buttons is different now. I will now be having 
        a single variable that changes to reflect the button that was selected and the shape that will be drawn
        as opposed to having a variable for each shape.
