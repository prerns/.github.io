        <h1>Final Project Writeup</h1>
        <h2>Overview and Usage</h2>
        <p class="intro-paragraph">
           This final project artboard is intended to be a art board for a user to draw on and doodle on. 
           Users have the ability to change the canvas color, drawing lines, rectangles and circles as well 
           as changing the color of the shapes you can draw. Finally, users can clear the canvas and save 
           their doodles to their computers. Try it out below!
           <div class="tile-grid">

        <h2>Development Process</h2>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Starting off with my prototype that could draw lines, I adapted that method to draw rectangles</li>
            <li>When the rectangles worked, I adapted that method to draw cricles and created a button for that</li>
            <li>After running into some issues of not being able to toggle on and off between shapes, I trouble shooted 
                and was able to make all the buttons work independently
            </li>
            <li>Created a task bar on the side of the canvas to act seperate from the canvas and not interfere with 
                functions such as mouseIsPressed, to place all the buttons
            </li>
            <li>As part of my stretch goal, I implemeted a color picker that would reflect the color of the things
                drawn
            </li>
            <li>Added lables to the color slider and color picker to let users know what they can use them for</li>
            <img 
            class="picture"
            src="/images/final_unfinished.jpeg" 
            alt="Image of plain yellow artboard"
            />
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Issue Deep-Dive</h2>
        <p>
            An issue that I had was that once I had all the shapes implemented when I pressed the circle button and drew circles
            and then switched to the rectangle button the circles would disappear and I could draw rectangles. When 
            I switched back to circles the circles would appear again and the rectangles would disappear. After reviewing the 
            methods for drawing each shape, I noticed that I was adding the shape to the shapes array as well as drawing the shapes
            within the array inside of the button pressed method call. After talking to Hannah, she suggested trying to take 
            actually drawing the shapes within the array outside of the button press method and put it in my draw loop. 
            This is because I want to draw the shapes in the other arrays no matter what button is pressed and currently were
            only being drawn if their shapes button was pressed. When I moved the drawing from the arrays for each shape 
            out into the draw loop my issue was fixed.
        </p>
        <h2>Ideas and Future</h2>
        <p>
          The next iteration of my project I want to be able to change the size of the shapes that are drawn. 
          This could be implemented with a slider that could refelct how large the user wants the shape to be drawn.
        </p>
        <h2>Kudos</h2>
        <p>
            I want to give Kudos to Elliana and Hannah for helping troubleshoot issues and working together to discuss differenet methods.
