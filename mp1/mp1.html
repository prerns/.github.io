        <h2>Overview and Usage</h2>
        <p class="intro-paragraph">
           I designed a bad word tracker Chrome Extension. The purpose of this extension is for you to be able 
           to scan webpages and get a understanding of the profanity you may encounter while reading the page.
           By clicking the scan button, the extension will scan the webpage and cross reference a list of 
           collected bad words and report back on the popup how many bad words were found. It takes up to 
           a couple seconds for the popup to scan the page so please be patient to see the output. <em>I would recommend
           for testing you use this extension on maybe a lyrics webpage for a song that you know has bad words, or
           a website that lists out bad words.</em>

        <h2>Development Process</h2>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Cloned the e-nator example and removed all elemented I wasn't going to use such as the check box.</li>
            <li>Sent an alert from content script that bushing the button on the popup was recieved.</li>
            <li>Created a list of common and easy words to scan for first.</li>
            <li>Adapted the function in enator example to fit my usage. This included adapting a function to 
                create a list of words for encountered text nodes and cross referecing them with my list of common
                words and track how many were found.
            </li>
            <li>Created alerts for all my debuggin in every function to see the flow of the code.</li>
            <li>Returned a alert with the counter number of how many words were found on a page.</li>

            alt="Image of lyrics page open with the popup and an alert popup with the number of bad words displayed"
            />
            <li>Sent that counter back to popup file and added HTML to my popup to display the number of words. </li>
            <li>Updated my list of words to now be a set of bad words to look for.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Issue Deep-Dive</h2>
        <p>
            One issue that I encountered and took a long time to resolve was trying to add the HTML of how
            many bad words were found. I performed my logic of counting how many bad words were on a page in 
            my content script file and thought that resultantly the content script file is the file that should
            communicate with the popup HTML file and add the components of HTML with the counter number to display.
            However, after having added the code in my content script file and adding the file as a source in the HTML 
            file, nothing was showing up on popup. I was stuck. After trying a couple different things of changing the HTML 
            code, still nothing was working. During OH with Hannah, I learned that the content script file cannot communicate 
            with the popup files. That is becuase the content script runs in its own world and if I do want to communicate 
            content from the content script to the popup, I have to do so by sending a message back to the popup file. I did this 
            by looking at the chrome developer documentation and seeing how to send a message to the popup file. Then
            I recieved the message with the counter value in the popup file and then used that value and the code for 
            how to add HTML to the popup in the file. This worked!

        <h2>Ideas and Future</h2>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Pay the $5 and pay for chrome to make my extension available for others to download and use.
            </li>
            <li>
              Provide a list of the bad words it found on the popup as well. 
            </li>
            <li>
              Have some sort of metric of whether or not the webpage is child appropriate or not.  
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Kudos</h2>
        <p>
            I want to give Kudos to Raina and Hannah. I would also like to give Kudos to the e-nator extension
            example that I was able to heavily use the framework for and adapt to my need.
