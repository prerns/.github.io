        <h2>Overview and Usage</h2>
        <p class="intro-paragraph">
          This project was a chance to explore P5js. I created 6 different images that each have a different 
          functionality. I decided to have a Christmas Tree theme that remains the same for each of the 6 drawings 
          and adds a new functionality in each drawing. 
          <ul>
            <li>Static Image: This image is a stand alone Christmas Tree</li>
            <li>Random Image: This image radnomizes the size and color of each ornament on the tree.</li>
            <li>Loop Image: This image features a spinning star on the tree.</li>
            <li>Interactive Image: The user can click anywhere on the tree to add a new ornament.</li>
            <li>Audio Image: The user can click on the screen to play a popular Christmas song.</li>
            <li>Audio Visual Image: The user can hover over the ornaments on the tree to play Christmas songs.</li>
          </ul>

        <h2>Development Process</h2>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>I created a statis basic Christmas tree first, inclusive of functions for each part of the tree so I could 
                make a consice draw fcuntion and make any changes efficiently with the functions.
            </li>
            <li>For the random drawing I made multiple for loops to randomize the radius of each circle drawn
                 as well as 3 random rgb values to pass into my ornament function. 
            </li>
            <li>To create an infinite loop, I looked at multiple online sources to find a way to create 
                a spinning star. I did so finally by using the rotate functon avaiable in p5js. 
            </li>
            <li>Initially for the interactive picture I wanted to decorate the tree by drawing multiple line but ended up 
                making the user click and add ornaments to the tree. I did so my creating a list and a circle function 
                that tracked the users mouseX and mouseY coordinates on a click and added it to a draw list that then
                drew circles where a user clicked. 
            </li>
            <li>I downloaded a mp3 of a popular Christmas song and played a song on a mouse click and off on 
                another mouse click. I had to incorporate the sound library for p5js which was different 
                than what I had done before.
            </li>
            <li>For combining an audio visual I had to search and examine a couple exampled of how 
                to make music play on a hover over a certain shape. This was done so by calculating the distance
                of the users mouse to the edge of the shape you're on. If its within the shape a function to play
                the music will be run and once the distance is greater than the shape, the music will stop.
            </li>
            <img 
            class="picture"
            src="/images/MP2Unfinished.png" />
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Issue Deep-Dive</h2>
        <p>
            An issue that I encountered was in my audio visual drawing where I was hovering over an ornament 
            and I was getting a distorted version of the song it should have been playing. It sounded like it was 
            playing over it self over and over. After investigating I realized the problem to be that I was 
            playing my song on a hover variable status in the draw loop. This means that my song was continously 
            playing becuase the hover variable status was always true and the song would keep playing over and over. 
            While I still wanted to keep my song playing in the draw loop I needed some sort of conditional to track 
            whether or not the song was already playing. After messing around with a couple ways and places to put this 
            variable, I opted for a global variable that would keep track of whether or not the song was already playing. 
            It took a couple tries to figure out where in my code I should update this variable but I figured it out. 
        </p>
        <h2>Ideas and Future</h2>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I would want to work on creating a more dynamic tree where the ornaments 
              are placed randomly on the tree using its dimensions.
            </li>
            <li>
              I would also like to have it so that each ornament plays a different song in the future.  
            </li>
            <li>
              In the future I would want to incorporate the screen to play multiple colors when playing a song
              in the audio drawing.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

            I want to give to Hannah and MacKenzie for helping me and debugging.
